# Diamond Rails
[Download on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/diamond-rails)

A mod to make minecarts useful in the late game by adding three new types of much faster powered rails.

## Rail Types
### Powered Rails (included for comparison)
The default vanilla powered rails. Top speed of 8 blocks per second.
### Diamond Rails
The lowest tier of new rails, crafted with the same recipe as powered rails but with diamonds instead of gold. Top speed of 32 blocks per second.
### Enhanced Diamond Rails
A step up from diamond rails, can either be crafted with the same recipe as diamond rails but with a chorus fruit in the empty space, or upgraded from diamond rails in a smithing table with a chorus fruit. Top speed of 90 blocks per second.
### Netherite Rails
The fastest rails in the mod, obtained by upgrading diamond rails or enhanced diamond rails with netherite in a smithing table. Top speed of 159â…” blocks per second (if you're wondering about the oddly specific value, this is the real-life [world speed record for a conventional high speed train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_speed_record#Conventional_wheeled)).

## Tips for Railway Building
Don't try to turn corners or go up/downhill at high speed, minecarts can't turn corners or go on slopes properly when they're moving at more than one block every tick. 
You'll want to slow the minecart down first with a stretch of normal powered rails (this needs to be at least 8 blocks long for netherite rails).
Ideally, your tracks should be as straight and flat as possible to avoid having to slow down.

You won't need many powered rails at all, especially with the higher tiers. Netherite rails can make minecarts go thousands of blocks with the momentum from just one rail.
